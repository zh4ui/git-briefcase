Next:
- should check whether gitdir is a relaltive path to git briefcase home
- serving the real content
- more comprehensive template execution message
- should output error to client

Improvement Areas
- use go generate to compile the source code of static files into the binary
- maybe godoc's vfs is worth noting
- how to reload server when code changes?
  - maybe githubnemo/CompileDaemon is worth noting
